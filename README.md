## 🚀 Getting Started

Once you have installed SwiftAnimPlayground, open the app. You will see two main modes: **Playground Mode** and **Compare Mode**. Each mode offers unique features to help you learn and experiment with SwiftUI animations.

### 🎉 Playground Mode

In Playground Mode, you can experiment with different SwiftUI animations in real-time. The key features include:

- **9 Animation Types**: Choose from `.spring`, `.smooth`, `.snappy`, `.bouncy`, `.easeIn`, `.easeOut`, `.easeInOut`, `.linear`, and `.interpolatingSpring`.
- **Interactive Parameters**: Adjust parameters like duration, bounce, stiffness, and damping. You will see immediate visual feedback as you make changes.
- **Multiple Shapes**: Test how animations work on circles and rounded rectangles.
- **Live Code Preview**: See the SwiftUI code generated for your current settings. This helps you understand how to implement what you see in your own projects.

### ⚖️ Compare Mode

Compare Mode allows you to analyze and compare up to three animation curves side-by-side. Key features include:

- **Triple Animation Display**: Run up to three different animations at the same time. This makes it easy to see how different curves behave.
- **Stacked or Side-by-Side**: Use toggle buttons to change the layout of the displays. Choose the view that works best for you.
- **Synchronized Playback**: All animations play together, allowing you to observe differences easily.

## 🌟 Features Overview

SwiftAnimPlayground helps you understand animation by visualizing different settings and styles. Here’s what you get:

- **Visual Exploration**: No programming required. Simply adjust sliders and see how the animation changes.
- **Code Learning**: Learn SwiftUI code dynamically as the app generates it for you based on your inputs.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed with the average user in mind, making it easy to navigate and use.

## 💻 System Requirements

SwiftAnimPlayground runs on macOS. The minimum requirements are:

- **macOS Version**: Ensure your system is running at least macOS 10.15 (Catalina).
- **RAM**: A minimum of 4GB RAM is recommended.
- **Processor**: Intel-based or Apple Silicon processor.

## 📘 Tips for Using SwiftAnimPlayground

1. **Explore Different Animations**: Take time to try out each animation type. Note how each behaves based on the changes you make.
2. **Play with Parameters**: Don’t hesitate to drag sliders to the maximum or minimum. This will give you a real sense of the extremes in animation effects.
3. **Use Live Code Preview**: After getting a good animation going, check the SwiftUI code. Copy this code into your own projects to see how it functions.
